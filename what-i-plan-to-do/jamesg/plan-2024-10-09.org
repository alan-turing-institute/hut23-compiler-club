I am planning to write a compiler; or, at least, the back end bits of
one.

Current next steps.

1. Find some version of Mike Spivey's C code which sets up a minimal
   environment and a main() function. The idea is to be able to use
   that to call functions generated from my "compiler".

2. Figure out how to emit assembly using the nanopass framework, and
   how to call the emitted code from the framework in (1).

3. Figure out the arm eabi calling convetion

4. Write the next level of the compiler (which is likely to be either
   function calls or register allocation).

- In ForkedProjects, in ~microbian~, ran ~make~. That compiled!

For next time: get hold of the updated version of the repo! Need to
either pull the Institute's fork, or update my fork,
